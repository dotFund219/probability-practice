# 📊 Probability & Statistics Practice with Python

## 📌 Overview

This project is focused on strengthening my understanding of Probability and Statistics through hands-on practice using Python.

After studying the theoretical concepts of:

- Gaussian (Normal) Distribution  
- Bernoulli Distribution  

I am now transitioning from conceptual learning to practical experimentation. The goal is to build intuition by computing probabilities, generating distributions, and visualizing results.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

### 1. Deepen Conceptual Understanding
- Reinforce theoretical knowledge through coding
- Understand the relationship between mathematical formulas and simulation results
- Develop intuition for randomness and variability

### 2. Practice with Distributions
- Generate random samples from:
  - Normal Distribution
  - Bernoulli Distribution
  - Binomial Distribution
- Compare theoretical probabilities with simulated results

### 3. Probability Computation
- Calculate probabilities using:
  - CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function)
  - PDF (Probability Density Function)
- Compute conditional probabilities
- Validate results using Monte Carlo simulations

### 4. Visualization
- Plot histograms of simulated data
- Overlay theoretical probability curves
- Compare distribution shapes as parameters change
- Observe how sample size affects convergence

### 5. Build Statistical Intuition
- Understand the Central Limit Theorem through simulation
- Explore how increasing trials changes distribution behavior
- Connect discrete distributions to continuous approximations
